Linux serial example based on the topic:
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6947413/how-to-open-read-and-write-from-serial-port-in-c

To compile the code:

$ git clone https://github.com/dominikbelter/serial_example
$ cd serial_example
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cmake ../
$ make

To run the code:

$ cd ../build/bin
$./demo_serial

The example works with the hardware available in our lab but you can adapt the code to your needs.
